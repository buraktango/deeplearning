# Introduction

A collection of exercises intended to be supplementary material to Goodfellow's *Deep Learning* book ([website](http://www.deeplearningbook.org)/[amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=YHXTQ9PV91G575WXSKHK)).

All the exercises were written by me while I read through the book. Suggestions and feedback are always welcome, simply raise an issue or initiate a pull request of suggested exercises/changes.

For Goodfellow's own currated list of exercises, see this github repo: https://github.com/goodfeli/dlbook_exercises
